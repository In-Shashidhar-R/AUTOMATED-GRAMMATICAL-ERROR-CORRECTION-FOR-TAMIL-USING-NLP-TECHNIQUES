### Dataset Description

The unified collection includes thousands of Tamil sentences containing both grammatical defects and spelling errors. The **Error-Annotated Tamil Corpus** consists of 27,283 sentences, while the **Tamil Grammar Large Dataset** contains 147,229 sentences. 

The dataset includes distinct Tamil sentences in separate rows, with fields documenting the incorrect material, along with the defective text and corresponding correction segments. This database supports extensive statistical research, showing error distributions and counts of specific errors, while describing linguistic patterns.

The collected data provides a clear understanding of the most widespread Tamil spelling and grammatical errors, which can aid developers in improving spell-checking and grammar correction models. The valuable information on Tamil language treatment and correction patterns makes this dataset useful for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applications.
