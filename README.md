# AUTOMATED-GRAMMATICAL-ERROR-CORRECTION-FOR-TAMIL-USING-NLP-TECHNIQUES

**Abstract**
The presented research adopts a new approach to identify and correct Tamil grammar errors by utilizing Natural Language Processing methodologies. Artificial intelligence relies heavily on natural language processing (NLP) because it has reshaped different domains, including sentiment analysis and machine translation. This research evaluates performance and computational accuracy, and practical use of two NLP models operating on two different datasets. This research employs modern machine learning methods to analyze NLLB-200 alongside MBart concerning their performance when used on Tamil Grammar Large Dataset along with Error Annotated Tamil Corpus which delivers extensive information about their advantages and weaknesses. The analytical measurements demonstrate the capabilities of various NLP systems to process textual information effectively. The study results help optimize NLP model deployment in real-world applications because they unite theoretical progress with practical needs. Thorough research evaluation helps develop NLP methods better while promoting breakthroughs in automated language comprehension systems. The research recommendations lead to improved methods for selecting NLP models and optimizing datasets which benefit natural language processing as a discipline.
